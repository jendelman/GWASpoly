This package was designed for genome-wide association studies in  autopolyploids (and also works for diploids). A [vignette is available](https://jendelman.github.io/GWASpoly/GWASpoly.html) to illustrate the basic workflow using the potato dataset that comes with the package. More detailed information is available in the [package reference manual](https://jendelman.github.io/GWASpoly/GWASpoly_manual.pdf).

Development of the package was supported by the USDA NIFA SCRI (Award #2011-51181-30629) and Hatch (Accession #1002731) programs.
